**Building Lovely: A Journey into Women's Wellness Tech**

Like many developers, my best projects come from solving real problems I've witnessed firsthand. Lovely started from a simple observation: women deserve better digital tools for their wellness journey.

I noticed that period tracking apps often fell into two categories - either overly clinical and data-heavy, or oversimplified to the point of being unhelpful. Women I spoke with wanted something that respected their intelligence while being genuinely supportive.

So I built Lovely - a women's wellness app that combines period tracking, task management, and daily affirmations in a thoughtfully designed, privacy-focused package.

**What makes it different:**
- Privacy-first architecture using Supabase with row-level security
- Accessible design following Flutter accessibility guidelines
- Warm, feminine aesthetic (Coral Sunset theme) without being patronizing
- Open source, so the community can contribute and learn

**Tech Stack:**
Flutter, Supabase (PostgreSQL), Firebase Cloud Messaging, Material Design 3

This is just Phase 1 - the foundation is solid with authentication, onboarding, and profile management. Next up: intelligent cycle predictions, symptom tracking, and wellness insights.

**Why open source?**
Because period health should be a conversation, not a proprietary black box. Other developers can learn from this, improve it, and even build their own versions for different communities.

To every woman who shared their frustrations with existing apps - this one's for you.

**Lessons from Building a Privacy-Focused Wellness App**

After spending [X weeks/months] building Lovely, a women's wellness app, I want to share some insights about building health-tech applications that respect user privacy and accessibility.

**The Challenge:**
Create a period tracking and wellness app that handles sensitive health data while being completely transparent about data handling and security.

**The Solution:**
Built with Flutter and Supabase, leveraging:
- Row-Level Security (RLS) ensuring users can only access their own data
- Supabase Auth for secure, compliant authentication
- Local-first architecture with cloud sync
- Full accessibility support from day one
- Open source codebase for transparency

**Key Technical Decisions:**

1. **Service Layer Pattern** - Abstracted all Supabase calls into a dedicated service class for maintainability

2. **Semantic Accessibility** - Every interactive element has proper semantic labels, following Flutter's accessibility guidelines

3. **Configuration Security** - Credentials gitignored with template files for easy contributor setup

4. **Progressive Onboarding** - Collects only essential data upfront, reducing signup friction while gathering necessary cycle information

**Current Features:**
- Email/password authentication with password recovery
- Personalized onboarding flow
- Profile management with cycle tracking data
- Dark mode support
- Clean Material Design 3 implementation

**What's Next:**
Phase 2 brings cycle predictions, calendar views, and symptom tracking. Phase 3 adds task management and daily affirmations.

**Why Open Source?**
Health tech should be transparent. Users deserve to know exactly how their data is handled, and developers can learn from real-world implementations of privacy-focused architecture.

**From Idea to Implementation: Building My First Full-Stack Flutter App**

Three months ago, I decided to tackle a real problem: women's wellness tracking apps that actually respect privacy and intelligence.

**The Journey:**

Started with wireframes and user interviews. Women wanted:
- Control over their data
- Intelligent predictions without feeling surveilled
- Beautiful design that didn't feel condescending
- Accessibility as a standard, not an afterthought

**The Build:**

Chose Flutter for cross-platform development and Supabase for the backend. The learning curve was real:
- Mastering Supabase's Row-Level Security policies
- Implementing proper authentication flows
- Building accessible UI components
- Managing async state properly
- Creating a reusable service layer

**What Worked:**
- Service layer pattern kept the codebase clean
- Supabase's built-in auth saved weeks of work
- Font Awesome icons elevated the design
- Early accessibility focus prevented technical debt

**What Was Challenging:**
- Managing auth state across navigation
- Designing an onboarding flow that felt personal, not invasive
- Balancing feature completeness with MVP timeline
- Writing comprehensive setup documentation

**Current State:**
Phase 1 complete - authentication, onboarding, and profile management working smoothly. The foundation is solid for building cycle tracking, predictions, and wellness features.

**The Code:**
Fully open source on GitHub. Includes setup instructions, database schema, and security policies. Whether you're learning Flutter, Supabase, or just curious about health-tech implementation, it's all there.

**What's Next:**
Building out the cycle tracking calendar, implementing prediction algorithms, and adding task management features. Planning to document the journey as I go.

Fellow developers - I'd love your feedback on the architecture. Users - let me know what features matter most to you.
